>>>Todo:

*[maybe] Add randomly generating world (presets, and detected by a value?)
*Finalize world size (9x9 is way too big, or maybe world sizes can be customized per new game?)
*Add F5 "interact" menu/functions
*Create Map for F1 Menu
*Add turn-based battles and battle animations (maybe include differing moves?)
*Add code that will display objects in the overworld
*[maybe] Add ability to name character
*Add town(s), hidden chests, and more overworld stuff
*[maybe] Add currency
*Have the F1 menu not update the list of objects under an item until you stop scrolling
*Add random encounters (Zelda II style, or Final Fantasy style?)
*Speed up 
*[maybe] Add end goal
*[maybe] Add physical obstacles

>>Done:
*Add confirmation prompt to exiting without saving
*Finalize character sprite
