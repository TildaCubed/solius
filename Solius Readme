>>-Starting and Playing-<<
	To start a new game, press 1 on the main menu. Select the size of the world you would like to play in, using the left
and right arrow keys. The size represents squares of 24*8 tiles, walkable or otherwise. If you don't know what this means,
select 4*4 for now by pressing Enter.
	To load a previous save file, press 2 on the main menu. If you don't have a save file, the game will follow the
procedures of step 1. Please note that if you start a new game and quit without saving, your save file will be that of a brand
new game.

To exit, press 3 on the main menu.

	To walk around, press the arrow keys. To access the menu, press F1. to interact with objects, stand over them and press
F5. A treasure chest "B" will open on it's own, without having to use F5. Interacting with a town ("A") will heal you,
if you are a big "O". If you have been healed, you will momentarily turn into a "^". To quit without saving, press Enter
twice. Please note that your save file will return to the state it was in when you last saved.
	In battles, press 2nd to attack the enemy. Press Alpha to cast a healing spell. It will take away 5 exp in return for
healing you. After you do either of these two things, the enemy will attack you. To flee, press MODE. If you fail to flee,
the enemy will also attack.
	To navigate the F1 menu, press left and right. This will scroll between STATS, MAP, and SAVE. To save, press enter when
the SAVE option is highlighted with the "*".
