>>>Todo:

*[maybe] Add randomly generating world (how is it saved?)
*Finalize world size (9x9 is way too big, or maybe world sizes can be customized per new game?)
*Add F5 "interact" menu/functions
*Create Map for F1 Menu
*Add turn-based battles and battle animations (maybe include differing moves?)
*Add code that will display objects in the overworld
*Add confirmation prompt to exiting without saving
*Add main menu (New Game, Load Game, Help, Quit)
*[maybe] Add ability to name character
*Finalize character sprite
*Add town(s), hidden chests, and more overworld stuff
*[maybe] Add currency
*Have the F1 menu not update the list of objects under an item until you stop scrolling
*Add random encounters
*Speed up menu and overworld transitions/redraws
*[maybe] Add end goal
